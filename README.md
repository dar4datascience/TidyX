### Description

The goal of TidyX is to explain how R code works. We are focusing on submissions to the #TidyTuesday Project to help promote the great work being done there. 

In this repository, you will find copies of the code we've explained, and the code we wrote to show the concept on a new dataset.

To submit code for review, email us at tidy.explained@gmail.com
