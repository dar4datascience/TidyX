### Description

The goal of TidyX is to explain how R code works. We are focusing on submissions to the #TidyTuesday Project to help promote the great work being done there. 

In this repository, you will find copies of the code we've explained, and the code we wrote to show the concept on a new dataset.

To submit code for review, email us at tidy.explained@gmail.com

  - Looking back at ones code can show you just how far you have come. Sparked by a conversation between Ben Baldwin (@benbaldwin), Patrick and Ellis, this weeks episode is on code review and refactoring. Ben went into his past and has furnished a set of code for us to try to refactor. In the spirit of things, neither of us looked closely at the code ahead of time, and recorded our initial reactions and process of refactoring Bens code into a function that could be applied to multiple datasets!

  - This week we reflect back on the past year and combine techniques from multiple episodes. We scrape multiuple tables from the the hockey reference website, use regular expressions to clean and organize the data, and use for loops to determine the optimal pythagorean win exponent.  We visualize the data using several different techniques, like scatter and lollipop charts. We show some fun tools with regularizing values for linear regressions and how how to predict and visualize the results.

  - This week we play with a new technique for optimizing, the `optim` function! We scrape the 2019-2020 NHL season to generate power rankings for every NHL team and home-ice-edge. We can use this to then predict team winning probability! We then combine that with season summary data to generate a pretty GT table!

- [Episode 49: MLB Batting Simulations](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep49)
  
  - We continue looking at simulations this week, but this time for individual players. Using {Lahman}, we pull the 2019 MLB player batting stats, and visualize the stats using histograms and density plots. Next, to generate confidence intervals around their batting averages we use rbinom() combined with techniques from the {tidyverse} to make simulation easy. Finally we visualize the data using {gt} combined with {sparklines}.

- [Episode 50: MLB Batting Simulations](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep50)
  
  - Another MLB Batting episode. This time we use the James Stein Estimator (paper below) to apply a shrinkage estimate to player batting averages to get a "true" estimate, removing luck. Using {Lahman}, we pull the 2018 MLB player batting stats, and explain how to implement the estimator. Next, we compare estimates against the 2019 season. Finally we visualize the data using {gt}, using header spans, and cell styling. For the grand finale we combine this gt table with batting averages with plots using patchwork!.

- [Episode 51: Deploying Models with Shiny](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep51)
  
  - Sharing the results of a modeling effort is an important skill of any data scientist. However, just sharing the weights of each predictory is often not good enough to get buy in from stakeholders who are understandably skeptical of your results. Using the power of shiny, you can show your stakeholders exactly how your model interprets and then predicts the results. In this episode, we use the {palmerpenguins} package with {randomforest} to generate a model to predict the species of a new penguin. With shiny, we then deploy our model to allow the users to record new penguins attributes to see whether the model things they are an Adelie, Chinstrap, or Gentoo! The output is a boxplot indicating the models probablity for each species given the inputs.

  - There are too many Gentoo, your PI proclaims. This weeks episode Patrick and Ellis talk how to use the {xaringan} package to produce reproducible html presentations using Rmarkdown syntax. We discuss how we looked at "raw" tech data and used summary statistics to compare against the gold standard {palmerpenguins} package from Dr. Allison Horst, Dr. Alison Hill, Data from Dr. Kristen Gorman. We use last weeks highly powerful machine learning model to generate presictions of species, and generate a confusion matrix of our data vs the predictions. Finally, we talk about the value of making your presentation based on Rmd and being able to update the presentation at the click of a button.

- [Episode 53: MLB Pitch Classification Introduction](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep53)
  
  - This week we start a series on using machine learning to automate pitch classification. In this first episode, we discuss ways to start looking at your data and questions to formulate. We use hierarchical clustering a few different ways to start to see relationships between the different pitch types and the statistics that were captured around each pitch!

- [Episode 54: MLB Pitch Classification 2 - KNN, Caret and UMAP ](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep54)
  
  - In the second episode on using machine learning to automate pitch classification from pitchfx data, we apply the K-nearest-neighbors algorithm as our first attempt at classification. We start with using the results from our naive hierarchical clustering to select 4 groups and apply the KNN algorithm. We then look at how we could evaluate performance of the model both with total mis-classification and within class mis-classification. Then we use {carat} to optimize for the best clustering and compare the results. Finally, we use UMAP to perform dimensional reduction to visualize mulitple dimensions as two and view relationships within the clusters.

- [Episode 55: MLB Pitch Classification 3 - Decision Trees, Random Forests, optimization ](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep55)
  
  - For the third episode in the series on using machine learning to automate pitch classification from pitchfx data, we talk about decision trees and its famous variant: random forests. We start by discussing what a decision tree is and its value. We visualize the results and discuss the quality of the fit. Then we expand on decision trees, using the Random Forest algorithm, and discuss its performance. Finally, we use {caret} and {doParallel} to do a grid search for optimal mtry, using parallel processes to speed up the search!.

- [Episode 59: MLB Pitch Classification 7 - Class Imbalance and Model Evaluation Intro ](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep59)
  
  - Throughout this series, we been attempting to predict pitch type using PitchF/X data. However, we have not directly addressed a major flaw in our data, class imbalance. The Four-seam FastBall consists of nearly 37% of our data! In this episode we apply a couple techniuqes to help address the class imbalance, and look at ways to evaluate our models performance. We talk about the pros and cons to consider, and set up for our last episode for the series.

- [Episode 60: MLB Pitch Classification 8 - Model Evaluation and Visualization ](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep60)
  
  - This week we apply everything we have learned over the last several weeks to attempt to pick the best model for our project. As a reminder, we are attempting to predict pitch type using a subset of PitchF/X data. We attempt to productionalize our evaluations by writing a series of functions that allow quick iteration across multiple input types and capturing of information. Finally, we visualize the evaluations using 2 gt tables. Thank you all so much for joining us for this mini series on ML models and being with us as we hit episode 60. This has been a wonderful ride!

- [Episode 61: Data Cleaning - Regular Expressions ](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep61)
  
  - Okay, we've gotta say it - there is nothing "regular" about regular expressions. BUT that does not mean they are not an incredibly valuable tool in your programming toolbox. In this episode we go through how to apply regular expressions to a dataset and talk through some of the common tokens you might use when applying a regular expression to your dataset.

- [Episode 72: Databases in R | Shiny and Databases](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep72)

  - The fastest way for a data scientist to multiply their impact is to get their customers to be able to do the analysis themselves (with guiderails of course). Shiny provides a great user interface, combing this with some basic queries your clients may want improves response time and allows them to search to their hearts content. This week we show you a simple way to add interactivity with your database using {shiny} to query teams mean point differential at home across the 2001-2002 seasons.

- [Episode 73: Databases in R | Shiny,Databases, and Reactive Polling](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep73)

  - Now that we have a shiny app that allows our users to access and interact with the data in our database, how do we make sure that the user configuration is showing the most up-to-date information for selection? This is done through reactive polling - a time out feature that checks to see if there are any update to the database and updates the UI selection interface accordingly. We discuss the benefits and how to use the reactivePoll function combined with an observeEvent function to really supercharge our shiny app!
