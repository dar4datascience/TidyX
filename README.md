### Hosts
[Ellis Hughes](https://twitter.com/Ellis_hughes) and [Patrick Ward](https://twitter.com/OSPpatrick). 

Ellis has been working with R since 2015 and has a background working as a statistical programmer in support of both Statistical Genetics and HIV Vaccines. He also runs the Seattle UseR Group. 

Patrick's current work centers on research and development in professional sport with an emphasis on data analysis in American football. Previously, He was a sport scientist within the Nike Sports Research Lab. Research interests include training and competition analysis as they apply to athlete health, injury, and performance.

### Description

The goal of TidyX is to explain how R code works. We are focusing on submissions to the #TidyTuesday Project to help promote the great work being done there. 

In this repository, you will find copies of the code we've explained, and the code we wrote to show the concept on a new dataset.

To submit code for review, email us at tidy.explained@gmail.com

- [Episode 30: Tweet Sentiment](https://bit.ly/TidyX_Ep30)
  
  - Patrick and Ellis were inspired this week by all the sentiment analysis performed for #TidyTuesday this week so we decided to look at tweets to show and comment on additional things to be aware of when doing sentiment analysis. Using {rtweet}, we pull over 50,000 tweets that used the #Debate2020, and discuss how context is incredibly important to analysis.

  - This weeks #TidyTuesday dataset was on NCAA Womens Basketball Tournament appearances. Patrick and Ellis in the past have shown how tables can be used for data visualization, and wanted to learn more about another one. {reactable} is a really cool looking package, so we spend some time showing how to use the package, apply column definitions, and even apply html widgets within the table!

  - This weeks #TidyTuesday dataset was on Mobile and Landline subscriptions across the world. This week we saw lots of animation type plots, and wanted to add our own. Using {plotly}, we make an interactive plot that animates across time to show how GDP is related to the raw subscription numbers. We also do some exploration with line plots.

  - Looking back at ones code can show you just how far you have come. Sparked by a conversation between Ben Baldwin (@benbaldwin), Patrick and Ellis, this weeks episode is on code review and refactoring. Ben went into his past and has furnished a set of code for us to try to refactor. In the spirit of things, neither of us looked closely at the code ahead of time, and recorded our initial reactions and process of refactoring Bens code into a function that could be applied to multiple datasets!

  - This weeks we reach into our mailbag to answer a request from Eric Fletcher(@iamericfletcher) on imputing NA's. In this video we scrape 2013 draft data, and impute using various techniques missing times for the three cone event. We also attempt to discuss Missing Completely at Random (MCAR), Missing at Random (MAR), and Missing Not at Random (MNAR) - but we decide at the end to leave it to the professionals.

She talks with us on common techniques she uses to process data, mixing base R with tidyverse. Then we spend some time discussing Alice's background, current role, and advice for folks looking to get started in sports analytics or R programming in general.

  - This week we reflect back on the past year and combine techniques from multiple episodes. We scrape multiuple tables from the the hockey reference website, use regular expressions to clean and organize the data, and use for loops to determine the optimal pythagorean win exponent.  We visualize the data using several different techniques, like scatter and lollipop charts. We show some fun tools with regularizing values for linear regressions and how how to predict and visualize the results.

  - This week we play with a new technique for optimizing, the `optim` function! We scrape the 2019-2020 NHL season to generate power rankings for every NHL team and home-ice-edge. We can use this to then predict team winning probability! We then combine that with season summary data to generate a pretty GT table!
